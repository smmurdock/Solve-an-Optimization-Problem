        "The development of this optimization solution closely aligned with my initial expectations in terms of the systematic methodology, but revealed several surprises regarding problem complexity and solver behavior that deepened my understanding of linear programming applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "Going into this project, I anticipated that the primary challenge would be correctly translating the mathematical model from Task 2 into executable code. I expected the PuLP library to handle the optimization mechanics automatically once the problem was properly formulated. My assumption was that if the mathematical representation was correct, the coding process would be relatively straightforward—define variables, add constraints, specify the objective function, and solve. I also expected the solution to utilize all three focus cities in some capacity, assuming that Amazon would have designed their network with all facilities serving active roles. The concept of a three-tier hierarchical network suggested balanced utilization across all tiers.\n",
        "\n",
        "The translation from mathematical notation to Python code proved more nuanced than anticipated. While PuLP's syntax is intuitive, several aspects required careful consideration. Creating the route tuples and filtering for valid combinations by excluding \"N/A\" entries required more attention than expected. I had to ensure that decision variables were only created for allowable routes, which meant carefully constructing the `routes_x`, `routes_y`, and `routes_z` lists by checking against the cost dictionary. Writing the constraints involved understanding PuLP's `lpSum()` function and how to properly iterate through filtered route combinations. The flow balance constraint at focus cities was particularly interesting, as ensuring that inbound exactly equals outbound required precise indexing of the decision variable dictionaries. Initially, I wasn't certain the model was correct until I saw the \"Optimal\" status, and the verification code in Section B1 became crucial for building confidence that the solution was not just mathematically optimal, but also operationally valid.\n",
        "\n",
        "Several outcomes challenged my initial assumptions. The most surprising result was that only Leipzig is used, while Hyderabad and San Bernardino remain completely idle at 0% utilization. This revealed that hierarchical networks don't necessarily require all tiers to be active—sometimes direct routing is more cost-effective than adding intermediary stops. This has real-world implications for Amazon's infrastructure planning. Additionally, CVG operating at exactly 100% capacity while AFW has 14% spare capacity suggests that the network design might benefit from capacity rebalancing or that CVG handles fundamentally different, higher-demand routes. This wasn't immediately obvious from the mathematical formulation alone.\n",
        "\n",
        "The solver's performance also exceeded my expectations. Despite having 191 decision variables and 73 constraints, it found the optimal solution almost instantly. This demonstrated the power of the simplex algorithm for transportation problems and reinforced the efficiency of modern optimization solvers. Furthermore, the output patterns revealed clear geographic routing logic that made business sense. All European and Indian shipments route through Leipzig, while all U.S. shipments go direct from hubs to centers. The mathematical optimization naturally discovered practical operational strategies without any explicit geographic rules being programmed into the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "This project reinforced several key lessons about optimization modeling. The quality of the code output directly reflected the quality of the mathematical model from Task 2. Time spent carefully defining constraints and the objective function in mathematical notation paid off during implementation. Writing the constraint verification code was not just about meeting assignment requirements—it was crucial for validating the solution. In a real-world setting, I would never trust optimization output without thorough verification. The solver's decision to leave two focus cities unused wasn't something I would have predicted through intuition alone, which highlights the value of mathematical optimization over intuitive human decision-making.\n",
        "\n",
        "PuLP proved to be an excellent choice for this problem. Its readable syntax and robust CBC solver handled the problem efficiently. However, I also learned that understanding the underlying linear programming theory is essential—the tool is only as good as the formulation you provide. The systematic workflow of formulate, code, solve, and verify matched my expectations, but the specific solution and the ease of implementation once properly structured exceeded them.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, the development process was mostly aligned with my initial expectations and had only a few surprising discoveries. The process reinforced that optimization is both an art, in terms of formulating the problem correctly, and a science, in terms of applying proven algorithms. While the mathematics and coding were important, the most valuable skill developed was the ability to interpret optimization results in the context of real-world operations and use verification techniques to build confidence in the solution."
